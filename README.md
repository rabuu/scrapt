# Scrapt
Script your Scratch.

The project is a work in progress and in an early stage of development.

## Usage
```console
$ scrapt new untitled-project
$ scrapt build ./untitled-project
```

## Goal
This project makes it possible to go back and forth between [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) projects and its own custom project structure and [in-house scripting language](lang/).
In this way it aims to provide a way to work with Scratch in a more traditional way of scripting instead of dragging blocks.
