# Scrapt

Script your Scratch.

This project makes it possible to go back and forth between [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) projects and its own custom project structure and [in-house scripting language](lang/).
In this way it aims to provide a way to work with Scratch in a more traditional way of scripting instead of dragging blocks.

It deprives the way Scratch functions of any meaning and there is no real-world usage for this project, at all.
Just a fun tool to build.
